# Winter course in analysis of RADseq data for molecular ecology and population genetics

This tutorial covers a brief introduction into performing population genetic analysis from RADseq data in the absence of a reference genome. Note that the second part of this tutorial is not specific to RADseq data and can apply to NGS data in general.

Topic 1: [RAD loci discovery from raw reads](https://github.com/iksaglam/Zonguldak/blob/main/Files/ID_Loci.md)

Topic 2: [Population genetic analyses using RADseq data](https://github.com/iksaglam/Zonguldak/blob/main/Files/Pop_Gen.md)
